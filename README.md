### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Filip, and I'm student at FEI STU in my second year currently pursuing bachelor's degree in Robotics and Cybernetics. I'm interested in mobile robotics, drones and AI.
<!--**Fleppe/Fleppe** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently working on my Bachelor's thesis, "Design of a mobile robot localization system without the use of external infrastructure in the ROS environment"
- ðŸš€ I recently published SVOC (student research activity) project "Mobile Robot Control" about SLAM algorithm evaluation in ROS2 simulation. <!-- Check it out [here]() -->
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning C++
